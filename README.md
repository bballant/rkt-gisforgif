rkt-gisforgif
=============

G is for Gif via Racket and ffmpeg

A less than perfect script for generating animated gifs from movies.

Aim it at your movies by modifying the 'movie-dir' value and possibly the regexp in the 'movie-list' function. Load it up in the racket repl and run 'gen-n-rando-movies' or 'gen-all-movies'.
